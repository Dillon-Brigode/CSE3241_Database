# **CSE 3241 Database**

## **Introduction**
This repository contains the final project code for our CSE 3241 class. We developed a relational database system to manage the inventory and sales operations for an online bookstore called Bits & Books. The project includes a final report, a complete SQL database with all necessary scripts, and data files to create the database based off of the schema we designed.

## **Repository Structure**
Below is an outline of the repository’s file structure:

    ├── scripts/                # Scripts which load the data files into the database
    │   ├── build_db.sh
    ├── sql/                    # Includes the schema for the Bits & Books database
    │   ├── schema.sql
    ├── .DS_Store

## **Project Details**
A final report was professionally presented with two main parts:

- **Database Description:**  
  Includes:
  - An ER diagram that visually represents the database design.
  - A detailed, annotated relational schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and noted functional dependencies.
  - An analysis of normalization for each table.
  - Explanations and rationales for the chosen indexes.
  - Descriptions of views along with their relational algebra, SQL code, and sample outputs.
  - A discussion and examples of three sample transactions.

- **User Manual:**  
  Includes:
  - Explanations of the real-world entities represented by each table.
  - Detailed descriptions of table attributes (data types and constraints).
  - Sample SQL queries with their English descriptions and relational algebra representations.
  - INSERT and DELETE syntax along with dependency instructions for correctly adding or removing records.
